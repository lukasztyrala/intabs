intabs, a jQuery plugin for simple

This is an pre-alpha-not-so-well-written release.
It works as for today but it is not perfect for
shure. I will try to improve it.

Some informations:

1. No #id needed.
2. No sections numbering needed.
3. You can have multiple .your-caintainer boxes on
   the same page and always only
   $('your-container').intabs(); is needed.
4. By adding class="normal" to <li> you exclude it 
   from beeing a tab.
5. You can add as many tabs and contents as you like
   and no numbering nor changes are needed.
6. Tabs change on "click" event but that can be 
   changed hacking the code. Simply replace the 
   "click" to eg. "mouseover".

Important! But remeber that ammount of <li> and tab
---------- contents (.tabbed by deafult) must match

Usage:

<div class="your-container">
  <ul class="tabs">
    <li class="normal">Tabs:</li>
    <li>[1]</li>
    <li>[2]</li>
    <li>[3]</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tabbed">[1]</div>
  <div class="tabbed">[2]</div>
  <div class="tabbed">[3]</div>
</div>

$('your-container').intabs();
