intabs, a jQuery plugin for simple tabbed content
-----------------------------------------------------------

Very simple plugin (a jQuery function to be honest) to turn
few lis and divs into tabbed content. This is for simple
things--no ajax, no fancy effects.


Informations:
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. No #id needed.

2. No sections numbering needed.

3. You can have multiple .your-caintainer boxes on the same
   page and always only $('your-container').intabs() is
   needed.

4. By adding class="normal" to <li> you exclude it from
   beeing a tab.

5. You can add as many tabs and contents as you like and no
   numbering nor changes are needed.

   .------.  Remeber that ammount of <li> (excluding those
   | Note |  with class .normal) and tab contents (class
   '------'  .tabbed by deafult) must match!

6. Tabs change on "click" event but that can be changed 
   hacking the code. Simply replace the "click" with, say,
   "mouseover".

7. If you want to start with other than first tab, specify
   the index of starting tab line this: .intabs(1). This
   works as array indexes, so 1st tab is 0, 2nd is 1, etc.


Usage:
-----------------------------------------------------------

<div class="your-container">

    <ul class="tabs">
        <li class="normal">Tabs:</li>
        <li>[1]</li>
        <li>[2]</li>
        <li>[3]</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tabbed">[1]</div>
    <div class="tabbed">[2]</div>
    <div class="tabbed">[3]</div>

</div>

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('your-container').intabs();
});
